# App Structure: Inspired by Discord Channels  

Our application is designed with functionality similar to how Discord channels operate. Here's a breakdown of how it works:  

## User Management  
- A user can sign up or log in to the app.  
- Once logged in, they can create, edit, or delete their own courses.  
- Users can also enroll in any course, which adds it to their "My Courses" section.  

## Course Visibility and Permissions  
- All courses created by users are visible in the **"All Courses"** section.  
- A logged-in user can view courses added by others but **cannot edit or delete them**.  
- However, they can enroll in these courses, which will add them to their **"My Courses"** section.  

## Discord Analogy  
- Think of a course as a Discord voice channel:  
  - Anyone can create a channel (or course).  
  - Once created, the channel is visible to others.  
  - However, only the creator has full control (edit/delete permissions) over it.  
  - Others can join (enroll) but cannot modify it.  

This structure ensures clarity in permissions while allowing collaborative interactions between users.
